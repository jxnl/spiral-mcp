# How to Build Better Python Applications

Python is a versatile language that excels in many domains. Here are some key principles for building better Python applications:

1. Use Type Hints
Type hints make your code more maintainable and help catch errors early. They also improve IDE support and make refactoring easier.

2. Follow the Zen of Python
- Simple is better than complex
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Readability counts

3. Implement Proper Error Handling
Always handle exceptions appropriately and provide meaningful error messages to users.

4. Write Tests
Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are crucial for maintaining code quality.
